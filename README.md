# Toronto-Apartment-Buildings-Project-Management-Analysis
The project involves end-to-end project management, including planning, resource allocation, risk assessment, and stakeholder communication, to deliver a data-driven Tableau dashboard evaluating Toronto's apartment building standards.

---

## Project Objectives  
- Develop a **comprehensive Tableau dashboard** showcasing Toronto's apartment building landscape.  
- Evaluate building conditions, repairs, and resident satisfaction across Toronto.  
- Identify patterns and trends in building quality across different neighbourhoods.  
- Analyze the correlation between building age, size, and evaluation scores.  
- Provide actionable insights for stakeholders to improve housing standards.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard**: Visualize key insights, trends, and patterns in building conditions.  
- **Geospatial Visualizations**: Map building locations and scores across Toronto neighbourhoods.  
- **Statistical Models**: Identify key factors influencing building evaluation scores.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover trends and correlations in the dataset.  
- **User-Centric Design**: Incorporate stakeholder feedback to ensure relevance and usability.

## Constraints  
- **Time**: The project must be completed by **November 30, 2024**, to align with the current schedule.  
- **Technical**: The dashboard must be compatible with the city's existing IT infrastructure, with potential for future updates.  
- **Data**: Analysis is limited to the available data in the Apartment Building Evaluation dataset.  

---

## Assumptions  
- The **Apartment Building Evaluation dataset** will continue to be updated regularly.  
- Stakeholders will provide timely feedback during the dashboard development process.  
- The project team will have access to necessary software and hardware resources.  
- The findings will be used to inform policy decisions and improve housing quality in Toronto.  

---

## Risks  
- **Data Quality Issues**: Inconsistencies or missing data in the Apartment Building Evaluation dataset.  
- **Regulatory Changes**: Changes in city regulations or evaluation criteria during the project timeline.  
- **Technical Challenges**: Difficulties in integrating data sources or creating complex visualizations.  
- **Stakeholder Resistance**: Potential resistance from property owners or managers to the public display of building scores.  

---

##Results
Key findings from the analysis include:

- Geospatial trends emphasize the need for targeted maintenance initiatives in underperforming neighbourhoods.
- Policymakers can use these insights to prioritize funding and improve tenant policies.
- Property managers and investors can focus their resources on buildings requiring the most urgent interventions.
